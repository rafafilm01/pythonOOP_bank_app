# description
the application is short showcase on how OOP in python works . 

We have:
- examples of classes
- examples of class inheritance 
- class dedicated for errors and error handling 
- lean methods that are re-used in other methods (for example for validation purposes)
- child classes overwriting methods from parents 
- finally  creating objects and calling out methods on these objects in oop_project.py
